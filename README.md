## Overview

I have developed a Pomodoro timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This timer helps users manage their work and break sessions effectively. The timer includes a settings button that allows users to customize the work and rest durations. It also features start, pause, and reset buttons for easy control. The timer progress is displayed on the webpage, along with the number of completed work sessions.

## How to Use

**1] Configure Settings:** Click the settings button to set your desired working and resting durations. 

**2] Start the Timer:** Press the start button to begin the timer. The timer will count down from the set working time.

**3] Pause the Timer:** If needed, you can pause the timer by clicking the pause button.

**4] Reset the Timer:** To reset the timer and start over, click the reset button.

**5] View Progress:** The timer progress is visually displayed on the webpage, and the number of completed work sessions is updated after each cycle. 

## Technical Details

- **HTML:** The HTML file defines the layout of the timer, including buttons for start, pause, reset, and settings, as well as the display area for the timer and completed sessions.

- **CSS:** The CSS file provides styling for the timer, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.

- **JavaScript:** Event listeners are attached to the buttons to handle user interactions. The timer functionality includes starting, pausing, resetting, and updating the timer display. The settings feature allows users to customize the working and resting intervals. Logic to track and display completed work sessions is implemented.
